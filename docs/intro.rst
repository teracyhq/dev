Introduction
============

Welcome to ``teracy-dev`` - get development fun!

We, Teraciers, believe that development experience is really important. That's why we care and make
sure our development environment must be consistent, smooth, and easy to setup. We don't have to
spend too much time for installing tons of development packages one by one, we want that setup
process must be automated.

And this ``teracy-dev`` repository was created for that purpose, to make sure working at Teracy with
ease and fun. We're going to use ``virtualbox`` for running isolated virtual machines, ``chef`` and
``vagrant`` for installing and configuring any necessary packages automatically.
